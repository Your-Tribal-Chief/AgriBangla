## 🎯 The Problem

In Bangladesh, farmers face a critical information gap:

- **Price Uncertainty:** Farmers don't know what price they'll get for their crops next week
- **Middlemen Exploitation:** Information asymmetry forces farmers into unfair deals with middleman syndicates
- **Lost Income:** Wrong market selection causes farmers to lose **15-20% of potential income**
- **Market Inefficiency:** Lack of real-time data prevents informed decision-making

**Agri-Smart BD** addresses these challenges by putting AI-powered market intelligence directly in the hands of farmers.

## 📊 Data Strategy & Methodology

### Current Approach (Prototype)

Due to the lack of granular historical agricultural data for Bangladesh available during the hackathon timeframe, we employed a **strategic data engineering approach**:

- **Proxy Dataset:** Utilized agricultural data from **Rajasthan and West Bengal, India**
- **Rationale:** These regions share similar **agro-climatic conditions** with Bangladesh (soil types, monsoon patterns, crop varieties)
- **Adaptation:** Converted Indian district names, crop names, and market contexts to Bangladesh equivalents
- **Data Sources:**
  - Crop price data (district-wise, date-wise)
  - Crop production data (yield metrics)
  - Soil analysis data (pH, nutrients, organic matter)
  - Water usage patterns

### Future Data Collection Plan

To enhance **accuracy and real-world performance**, our roadmap includes:

1. **Extensive Market Surveys:** Conduct field surveys across major districts in Bangladesh
2. **Government Partnerships:** Collaborate with DAM (Department of Agricultural Marketing) for official data
3. **Farmer Input Programs:** Crowdsource real-time pricing data through mobile app
4. **IoT Integration:** Deploy soil sensors for live soil condition monitoring
5. **Historical Data Acquisition:** Partner with agricultural universities for research datasets

**Note:** This is a **functional prototype** demonstrating AI capabilities. With local Bangladesh data, prediction accuracy will significantly improve.
